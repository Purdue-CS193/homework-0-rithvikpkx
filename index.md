# Rithvik's First CS190 Homework

### My Favorite Things About CS193
- Learning Git. I know some basic stuff like commit, push, and pull. But I haven't gotten the opportunity to work with various branches and learn how to handle branches. So I'm excited to learn that

- I like how chill the class seems to be. It doesn't seem to be a super intensive and stressful class.

- I like how PSO's are online
